# HotelManagementSystem
Developed a full-featured hotel management web application with separate admin and user panels using Laravel. Implemented role-based authentication with Sanctum, enabling secure access and tailored permissions. Key features include room listing with availability status, reservation management, real-time admin-user chat, and interactive DataTables. The admin dashboard offers analytics, user/room control, and reservation oversight, while users can search and book rooms through a responsive and user-friendly interface.
